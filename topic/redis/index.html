<p>We recently <a href="https://www.docusign.com/blog/accelerating-the-digital-transformation-journey-with-the-docusign-spring-14-release?utm_source=HOOTSUITE&amp;utm_medium=SOCIALPOSTS&amp;utm_campaign=SEPTEMBER">launched</a> 
<strong><a href="https://www.docusign.com/new-experience">The New DocuSign Experience</a></strong>,
a reimagining of our primary web application used by 45 million&nbsp;users.</p>
<p>The app is built in Node.js and uses the <a href="https://www.docusign.com/developer-center/quick-start/overview"><span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span></a>
as its data store. We’re proud to have built the entire app on an open-source stack, 
and plan to share a lot of our code in the coming&nbsp;months.</p>
<p>We aimed to follow best practices throughout:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself"><span class="caps">DRY</span></a> modular code;
automated deployment, provisioning, and continuous integration;
(a goal of) 100% automated front-end testing;
two-week sprints and releases, with scrums combining dev+<span class="caps">QA</span>+<span class="caps">UX</span>+product;
utilizing the latest browser capabilities while degrading gracefully for older browsers;
and using Git-flow and Github-style&nbsp;workflows.</p>
<p>The project first began in June 2012 with one developer and a vision of
building the next-generation web app as a front-end layer on top of the
<span class="caps">API</span>. After a period of prototyping and setting the
groundwork, the project (codenamed <em>“Martini”</em>) kicked into high gear
around a year ago. The team now consists of twelve developers, including three
dedicated to <span class="caps">QA</span> automation; a team of designers, two product managers,
and all the other amazing support (ops, program management, facilities)
that keep the servers humming and the stars&nbsp;aligned.</p>
<p>We launched a public beta in September, and became DocuSign Beta; now
we’re official, but we still affectionately call the project and team <em>Martini</em>. </p>
<h3 id="ubiquitous-javascript">Ubiquitous&nbsp;Javascript</h3>
<p>Martini is built on an all-Javascript (actually <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>) stack.
On the backend that includes <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>,
<a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mikeal/request">Request</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/flatiron/winston">Winston</a>, among many other libraries.
Ubiquitous <span class="caps">JS</span> means we can share code and patterns between the front- and back-ends:
<a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> handles models, views, and routing client-side, as well as
parallel models server-side. All our coffee/js files use the same module
pattern, bundled by <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/stitch">Stitch</a> for the browser.
Templates on both sides are in <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a>.
<a href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/">Stylus</a> preprocesses our <span class="caps">CSS</span>.
We use <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> for sessions and
caching. The app uses the 
<a href="https://www.docusign.com/developer-center/quick-start/overview">DocuSign <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span></a>
(a highly scalable, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_grade">carrier grade</a> 
system built on the .<span class="caps">NET</span> stack) as its data store,
so we don’t need a full&nbsp;database.   </p>
<p>To support the entire new experience, <a href="https://www.docusign.com/developer-center/quick-start/overview">our <span class="caps">API</span></a>
grew from serving a relatively
narrow set of third-party use cases to supporting every customer-facing application function.
Not all of these <span class="caps">API</span> features are public yet, but they will be soon.

Like any component in the system, there’s a potential risk of failure, and graceful failover to a “slave” instance is a way to mitigate the impact. We use <a href="http://redis.io/topics/sentinel"><strong>Redis Sentinel</strong></a> to help manage this failover&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>As the <a href="http://redis.io/topics/sentinel">docs</a> describe,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Redis Sentinel is a <strong>distributed system</strong>, this means that usually you want to run multiple Sentinel processes across your infrastructure, and this processes will use agreement protocols in order to understand if a master is down and to perform the&nbsp;failover.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, each node server has its own sentinel corresponding to each redis cluster [master and slave(s)] that it connects to. We have one redis cluster, so <strong>for N node servers, there are N sentinels</strong>. (This isn’t the only way to do it - there could be only one sentinel, or any other configuration really, but the 1:1 ratio seems to be the simplest.) Each sentinel is connected to the master and slaves to monitor their availability, as well as to the other sentinels. If the master goes down, the sentinels establish a “quorum” and agree on which slave to promote to master. They communicate this through their own pub/sub&nbsp;channels.</p>
<p><strong>The sentinel is not a proxy</strong> - the connection to the sentinel doesn’t <em>replace</em> the connecton to the master - it’s a separate instance with the sole purpose of managing master/slave availability. So the app connects to the sentinel in parallel with the master connection, and listens to the chatter on the sentinel channels to know when a failover occurred. It then has to manage the reconnection to the new master on its&nbsp;own.</p>
<p><a href="/articles/redis-sentinel-client-nodejs/redis-sentinel-diagram.pdf"><img src="/articles/redis-sentinel-client-nodejs/redis-sentinel-diagram.png" alt="Redis Sentinel Client flow diagram"></a></p>
<p>We’re using the standard <a href="https://github.com/mranney/node_redis">node_redis</a> library, which is robust, easy to use, and works “out of the box” for things like <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/connect-redis">sessions</a>. But a year ago, when Sentinel started to gain adoption, the best approach for adding <a href="https://github.com/mranney/node_redis/issues/302"><strong>Sentinel awareness</strong></a> to node_redis clients wasn’t clear, so a thread started on Github to <a href="https://github.com/mranney/node_redis/issues/302">figure it&nbsp;out</a>.</p>
<p>One simple approach was for the application to simply hold two connections, for sentinel and master, and when the sentinel reports a failover, to reconnect the master. But the way node_redis works, any <strong>data in transit during the failover is lost</strong>. Also with this approach, the code listening to the Sentinel’s pub/sub chatter lived in the application, and wasn’t as <strong>encapsulated</strong> as we thought it should&nbsp;be.</p>
<p>So we decided to create a middle tier, a <strong>redis sentinel client</strong>, that would handle all this automatically.
